# Chess

This is a chess game for the console written entirely in Rub I utilized third party keybindings in order to make accessing the board easier. The code behind this game took two full days to work on, inspired by the instructions of App Academy. 

## To play

In order to play this game, follow these instructions:
-  Install Ruby. If you are on a Mac the easiest way to do this is enter your console, install homebrew and type in:
   ```
      brew install ruby 
   ```
-  The next step is to clone the package to your desktop. In your command line type in:
   ```
      git clone https://github.com/jack/chess.git
   ```
- To run the game, next enter the chess folder and run the game with ruby:

      ruby game.rb
   ```
